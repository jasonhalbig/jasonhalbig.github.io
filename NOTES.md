# Summary

This will be my first project using a stack consiting of Ruby, Middleman and Bourbon, Neat & Bitters.
I am keeping a log of lessons learned, tools used and issues encountered for future reference.


# Log Lessons Learned and Issues Encountered
---

## Saturday - July 8th
* Learned how to deal with varying versions of Ruby i.e. global vs local.
* Ran into issues with moving from rvm to rbenv as it relates to Ruby version.
  I beleive I began setting my enviroment up with rvm wich caused issues downstream.
  I ran into an issue where the local Ruby was set to 2.4.0 as was the config.rb
  However when trying to run the middle man build 2.4.1 was being recogized as the configured Ruby version.
  Netlify does not currently support 2.4.1 so watch out for that in the future.
* Currently having issues rendering the Segment partial, event though it is configured per the documentations.
